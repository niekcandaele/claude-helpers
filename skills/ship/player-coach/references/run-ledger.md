# The run ledger

The coach's convergence machinery — what was found, what was decided about it, what
the player was told, what came back — used to live only in the coach's own context.
Every rule that depended on it was really a rule about recall: *compare this finding
against the previous ones* only works if the previous ones are still in view.

They are not always still in view. A long run compacts, and a summariser keeps the
top few items of a report it saw thousands of tokens ago. The coach then passes on
everything it can still see, which is a fraction of what it was told to pass on, and
it does so without any sense that something is missing. Rounds stop converging: the
same problems get re-found under new names, and the feedback set shrinks to whatever
survived the squeeze.

The ledger is the fix, and the fix is not the file — it is the habit of reading the
file. A ledger that exists but is recalled rather than re-read buys nothing.

## Where it lives

```
$XDG_STATE_HOME/player-coach/{project}/{change_key}/
  ledger.json            the run ledger
  feedback/turn-{n}.md   the rendered feedback set handed to each player turn
  reports/{n}.json       the verify JSON report for each verification run
```

Fall back to `~/.local/state/player-coach/...`, then `~/.player-coach/...`. This
mirrors `epic-runner`'s state convention, and for the same two reasons: never inside
the repository, because a long run would litter the diff under review; never in
`/tmp`, because a reboot mid-run would destroy the record of everything decided so
far.

- `project` — the canonical base repository slug resolved while preparing the target.
- `change_key` — the feature branch name, slugified. The branch is chosen before the
  first commit and carries the ticket identifier, and on `--resume-ci` it is checked
  out before anything else, so the key is available and stable on both entry paths.

Record `prUrl` in the ledger once it exists, but never key on it: at turn 1 there is
no PR.

**The ledger is written under `--no-pr` too.** That mode publishes no remote trace,
which is precisely why the local record has to exist — otherwise a local-only run has
no memory at all.

Directory mode 0700, files 0600. Single writer: the coach. Write by creating
`ledger.json.tmp` in the same directory, flushing it, and renaming over the target, so
a crash never leaves a half-written ledger.

Keep the directory after the run — it is the friction record the epic report wants.
Prune directories untouched for 30 days at startup.

## The epic quarantine file

A ledger is per-change, and that is right for findings: identity is defined by path and
defect mechanism against one diff, so merging ledgers across branches would make `matchedTo`
meaningless. Quarantine entries are the exception. They record something proved about the
*environment* — a suite that was already broken at the merge base and that the change never
touches — and that proof does not stop being true when the next issue starts.

`--epic-quarantine=<path>` names a file holding an array of quarantine entries in exactly the
schema below, shared by every run in one epic:

- **Seed** the ledger's `quarantine` array from it at Phase 0, then apply the closing rule to
  each seeded entry against *this* run's merge base and diff. An entry whose paths now appear
  in the diff, or whose merge base has moved, is invalidated and re-diagnosed once — inherited
  evidence is still evidence about a specific state of the world.
- **Append** when this run opens an entry, and mirror `active: false` when it invalidates one.
- Writes are serialised by the orchestrator, which runs one implementation at a time, so
  there is no concurrent writer to reconcile.

Without the flag, quarantine behaves exactly as it always has and lives only in the ledger.

## Relationship to the run trace

These are not two copies of the same thing.

| | Run ledger | Run trace |
|---|---|---|
| Medium | local disk | forge comments |
| Lifetime | the run, plus a retention window | permanent, immutable |
| Read | every round | only on resume |
| Role | live working state | published projection and disaster recovery |

The ledger is the write-ahead record; the trace is its immutable published
projection. The trace gains two keys inside the *existing* canonical payload —
`ledger` and `ledgerDigest` — rather than a second comment mechanism or a new
`recordKind`.

Precedence, stated plainly because two records invite split-brain:

- **Within a run** the ledger is authoritative; the trace is append-only output.
- **On resume** the trace wins. It is the authenticated, attribution-checked artifact;
  the local file may be stale, from another machine, or absent. Rebuild the ledger
  from the newest complete authenticated payload's `ledger` key and extend it. If a
  local ledger disagrees, record the divergence as interruption evidence.
- **Under `--no-pr`** there is no trace, so the ledger is authoritative
  unconditionally. A lost ledger there means lost carry-forward, and that is a real
  limitation of the mode rather than something to paper over.

### `disposition`

`open` · `fixed` · `accepted-below-threshold` · `deferred-out-of-scope` · `quarantined`

**Stickiness is derived, not stored**: a finding is sticky when `occurrences > 1` and
`disposition` is `open`. Making it a sixth enum value would let a finding be both
sticky and fixed, which means nothing.

### `depth` and `fullAudit`

Two different axes, easy to conflate. `depth` is *which reviewers ran* — `full` or `light`.
`fullAudit` is *how much of the diff they reviewed* — false when the run was delta-scoped by
`--since`. A light run can be a full audit, and a full run can be delta-scoped.

### `class`

`correctness` · `security` · `coverage` · `comment` · `ux` · `visual` ·
`test-failure` · `environment` · `style` · `plan-completeness`

The coverage rules and the quarantine rules both key on this, so the boundary between
`coverage` and `correctness` has to be sharp. Skills emit `class` as a hint; verify
assigns the final value during dedup.

### Finding identity

Two findings are the same finding when:

1. the normalised `location.path` is equal — **path equality is mandatory, never
   merge across files** — and
2. either the stated root cause describes the same defect mechanism, or both name the
   same symbol and the same symptom.

Line ranges drift as the diff grows and are not part of identity.

Record `matchedTo` and `matchReason` whenever a match is made. A wrong merge hides a
finding and a wrong split preserves the drift; neither is preventable in general, so
the decision is written down where a human can audit it afterwards.

## Write protocol

| When | What is written |
|---|---|
| Phase 0, initialising state | create, or rebuild from the trace on resume; record run number, threshold, base, plan |
| Phase 1 step 1, after the player returns | the turn record, including `feedbackItemsAddressed` from the player's receipt table |
| Phase 1 step 3, as soon as the report is read | the verification-run record, *before* gates — so a crash mid-gate is recoverable |
| Phase 1 step 4, after reconciliation | findings, dispositions, quarantine updates, coverage decisions |
| Phase 1 step 5, after publication | comment identifiers |
| Phase 3 | CI failures |
| Phase 4 | the terminal status |

## Read protocol

Re-read `ledger.json` in full before deciding gates, before rendering a feedback file,
and before composing any player prompt.

Not "consult your memory of it" — read the file. The whole point is that the coach's
memory of round 2 is exactly what a long run takes away, and the file is what remains
when it does.
